**Provisional differential diagnosis (ranked by likelihood given the history)**

1. **Acute pancreatitis** – classic epigastric pain boring to the back,
   vomiting, relief on leaning forward, risk factor of recent heavy alcohol
   intake, possible steatorrhoeic stools and low-grade jaundice.
2. **Gallstone-related disease**
   - **Biliary pancreatitis** (commonest aetiology of pancreatitis worldwide)
   - **Acute calculous cholecystitis / biliary colic** – similar pain pattern
     but usually more colicky and right-sided.
3. **Peptic ulcer disease or perforated duodenal ulcer** – severe epigastric
   pain, exacerbated by food; NSAID use could aggravate.
4. **Acute myocardial ischaemia (inferior wall)** – epigastric pain radiating to
   the back can mimic pancreatitis; must be ruled out urgently.
5. **Less common considerations** – gastric or pancreatic neoplasm with
   obstruction, acute mesenteric ischaemia, spontaneous bacterial cholangitis.

### Investigations to confirm or exclude the leading diagnoses

**Bedside / immediate**

- Vital-signs monitoring, urine output, pulse oximetry.
- 12-lead ECG and cardiac troponin to exclude myocardial infarction.
- Point-of-care serum glucose (hyperglycaemia is common in pancreatitis).

**Laboratory**

- **Serum amylase and lipase** (lipase more sensitive/specific) – ≥3× upper
  limit strongly supports pancreatitis.
- Complete blood count, C-reactive protein and pro-calcitonin (severity,
  infection).
- Comprehensive metabolic panel including **calcium**, creatinine and
  electrolytes (severity scoring).
- Liver chemistry (AST, ALT, ALP, γ-GT, total and conjugated bilirubin) to look
  for biliary obstruction.
- Fasting lipid profile (hypertriglyceridaemia can trigger pancreatitis).
- Lactate (rule out mesenteric ischaemia).
- Pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age.

**Imaging**

- **Trans-abdominal ultrasound** – first-line to detect gallstones,
  common-bile-duct dilatation or gallbladder wall thickening.
- **Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis** at 48–72 h if diagnosis remains
  uncertain or to grade severity/necrosis (delayed timing avoids
  underestimation) citeturn0search10.
- Magnetic-resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound if
  stones are suspected but not seen on ultrasound.
- Chest and upright abdominal X-ray (look for free air under the diaphragm
  suggesting perforated ulcer).

**Functional / endoscopic (as indicated)**

- Upper GI endoscopy if perforated or bleeding ulcer is suspected.
- Early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) only if
  cholangitis or persistent ductal obstruction is demonstrated.

### Initial symptom-directed management that will not interfere with diagnostics

**1. Bowel rest and fluids**

- Keep the patient **nil per os (NPO)** initially.
- Begin **intravenous isotonic balanced crystalloids** (e.g., Lactated Ringer’s)
  at 3 mL/kg/h, titrating to urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/h and haemodynamic
  targets. Early goal-directed but _not_ overly aggressive hydration reduces
  complications citeturn0search6turn0search11.

**2. Analgesia**

- Adequate pain control improves respiratory excursion and overall outcome.
- **Parenteral opioids** (e.g., hydromorphone 0.5–1 mg IV every 2–3 h as needed,
  or patient-controlled analgesia) are safe; they do **not** confound
  biochemical tests or imaging.
- Avoid further NSAIDs until ulcer disease is excluded.

**3. Antiemetics**

- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV every 6 h** or **metoclopramide 10 mg IV** for
  refractory nausea; these agents have no impact on pancreatic enzymes or
  imaging.

**4. Gastric decompression (if vomiting is profuse)**

- Nasogastric tube on low suction can relieve retching and reduce aspiration
  risk; does not alter diagnostic accuracy.

**5. Oxygen & monitoring**

- Supplementary O₂ to keep saturation > 94 %.
- Serial assessment of vital signs, urine output, haematocrit and CRP during the
  first 48 h (prognostic scoring).

**6. Alcohol abstinence and counselling**

- Clearly advise complete cessation; repeated alcohol exposure worsens outcome.

**7. Empiric acid suppression**

- Intravenous **pantoprazole 40 mg daily** can be started if peptic ulcer
  disease is strongly suspected; PPIs do not influence pancreatic enzyme
  interpretation.

**Antibiotics** are _not_ started routinely in presumed sterile acute
pancreatitis; reserve them for documented infection or cholangitis

### When results return

Once enzyme levels, imaging, and ancillary tests are available, the differential
can be narrowed, specific aetiology (alcoholic vs gallstone) defined, and
targeted interventions (e.g., cholecystectomy, ERCP, triglyceride-lowering, H.
pylori eradication) planned. Early surgical or gastroenterology input is
essential.
