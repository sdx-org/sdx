### Comprehensive treatment plan for confirmed acute pancreatitis

**1. Acute-phase (in-hospital) management**
• **Goal-directed intravenous hydration** with a balanced crystalloid (e.g.,
Lactated Ringer’s) at 5–10 mL/kg/h during the first 12–24 h, then titrate based
on urine output (>0.5 mL/kg/h), hematocrit, BUN and lactate. Over-resuscitation
is harmful, so reassess every 4 h. cite turn0search6
• **Analgesia** – IV opioids (e.g., hydromorphone or morphine) on demand or via
patient-controlled analgesia. Opioids do not mask complications or alter enzyme
values.
• **Antiemetics** – ondansetron or metoclopramide as needed for nausea.
• **Early oral feeding** – if pain is controlled and no ileus, start a low-fat
solid diet within 24 h; this shortens length of stay and reduces complications
cite turn0search14 . If oral intake is impossible after 48-72 h, begin enteral
nutrition via nasogastric/jejunal tube rather than parenteral nutrition cite
turn0search5 .
• **Routine antibiotics are not indicated**; give them only for proven infection
or cholangitis.
• **Venous thrombo-embolism prophylaxis** with low-molecular-weight heparin
unless contraindicated.
• **Severity monitoring** – BISAP or APACHE II scoring daily; continuous pulse
oximetry; serial metabolic panels. Escalate to ICU if persistent organ failure
(>48 h).

**2. Etiology-specific and interventional therapy**
• **Biliary pancreatitis** (stones/sludge):
 – Urgent **ERCP within 24 h** if cholangitis or persistent biliary obstruction.

– **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy before discharge** in mild cases to prevent
recurrence cite turn0search0 .
• **Alcohol-related pancreatitis:** absolute abstinence, brief counselling,
thiamine 100 mg IV/day for three days then orally, and referral to addiction
services.
• **Hypertriglyceridaemia:** if triglycerides > 1000 mg/dL, start insulin
infusion ± plasmapheresis.
• **Pancreatic necrosis / collections:** adopt a “step-up” strategy—delay
interventions for 4 weeks to allow walling-off; start with
percutaneous/endoscopic drainage, reserving minimally invasive necrosectomy for
those who fail less invasive approaches cite turn0search0 .

**3. Nutritional strategy and diet progression**
_While hospitalised_
• Begin with a low-fat (<30 g/day), solid diet as tolerated. Advance texture
rather than waiting on serum enzymes.
• If tube feeding is required, use a polymeric formula delivered nasogastrically
or naso-jejunal; both routes are equivalent for outcomes cite turn0search13 .

_Post-discharge long-term diet_
• **Low-fat pattern for six to eight weeks**: ≤30 g fat/day, small frequent
meals, emphasise lean proteins, whole grains, fruit and cooked vegetables cite
turn1search1 .
• Reintroduce moderate amounts of healthy fats (e.g., olive oil, omega-3-rich
fish) gradually if symptoms stay quiescent.
• Strict **alcohol abstinence** and **smoking cessation**—both strongly reduce
relapse risk.
• Maintain **adequate hydration** (--2 L water daily) and limit sugary drinks.
• If weight loss occurs or oral intake is inadequate, involve a dietitian early
for calorie-dense, low-fat meal planning or supplemental enteral formulas.

**4. Medications after the acute phase**
• Continue simple oral analgesics (acetaminophen ± tramadol) and taper opioids
quickly.
• **Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)** (e.g., pancrelipase 40 000–50
000 lipase units with main meals, half with snacks) if steatorrhoea, weight
loss, or fecal elastase <200 µg/g occur; monitor response and titrate cite
turn2search1 .
• **Proton-pump inhibitor** once daily for gastric protection when on high-dose
PERT or NSAIDs.
• **Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K** and **calcium + 25-OH vitamin D** levels
every 6–12 months; supplement deficiencies proactively cite turn2search7 .
• **Statin or fibrate** therapy if hyperlipidaemia persists.
• **Glycaemic surveillance**: fasting glucose or HbA1c every six months; treat
new-onset diabetes according to standard algorithms.

**5. Lifestyle optimisation and follow-up**
• **Physical activity:** resume light aerobic exercise once pain free; aim for
≥150 min/week to reduce insulin resistance and triglycerides.
• **Body-weight management:** target BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²; enlist dietetic and
behavioural support for weight loss if obese.
• **Psychosocial care:** screen for depression/anxiety; provide counselling for
alcohol use disorder.
• **Follow-up imaging:** abdominal ultrasound 6 weeks after biliary pancreatitis
to confirm ductal clearance; CT/MRCP at 3 months if necrotic collections were
present.
• **Specialist review:** gastroenterology clinic at 4–6 weeks, then every 3–6
months during the first year to monitor for chronic pancreatitis, exocrine
insufficiency, or diabetes.

**6. Surgical considerations beyond cholecystectomy**
• **Recurrent attacks despite optimal management** may warrant evaluation for
endoscopic sphincterotomy or definitive resections in rare structural
anomalies.
• **Pancreatic pseudocyst** causing pain, gastric outlet obstruction, or
infection: endoscopic cyst-gastrostomy or percutaneous drainage.
• **Disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome**: multidisciplinary discussion for
endoscopic vs surgical drainage.

**7. Evidence-based supplements and adjuvant measures**
• **Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil** can provide caloric density without
requiring pancreatic lipase, added to meals in those struggling to meet energy
needs.
• **Omega-3 fatty acids** (1–2 g/day EPA +DHA) may reduce post-pancreatitis
hypertriglyceridaemia, though definitive outcome data are limited.
• **Probiotics are _not_ recommended** routinely; trials showed no benefit and
possible harm in severe disease.
• **Thiamine 100 mg/day orally for one month** in all alcohol-related cases.
• **Multivitamin with minerals** once daily if diet remains restricted.

**Key counselling points for the patient**
“Your pancreas is inflamed but recovering. In the short term we control pain,
keep you well hydrated, and start food early. The attack was triggered by
[gallstones / alcohol / triglycerides]; removing that trigger is critical, so we
will arrange **(cholecystectomy / alcohol-cessation programme / lipid-lowering
treatment)**. For the next few weeks, follow a low-fat diet, avoid all alcohol
and tobacco, and take enzymes if your stools stay pale or greasy. We’ll check
your labs and weight regularly and adjust the plan if signs of pancreatic
insufficiency or diabetes appear.”
